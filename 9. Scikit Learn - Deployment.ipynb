Instead of serializing two and possibly three structures, we would use `pipeline` to handle the serialization and deserialization. Without loss of generality, the things that I will show in this notebook is applicable to independent and separate components of the system(namely vectorizer, fature selector and classifier) as well. However, `pipeline` is preffered way to persist your whole __machine learning pipeline__."

      "- `Pipeline` is not just useful for abstraction but also easier to maintain, persist and deploy.\n",
      "- Do not use a loss-compression technique to compress serialization.(Tarballs would work fine)\n",
      "- If you want to create exact environment of your training set, use always `virtualenv` and note the version numbers of the libraries that you are using.(See the Notebook 0)\n",
      "- Some of the algorithms support `partial_fit` function for online learning. ([SGD Classifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDClassifier.html), [Perceptron](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.Perceptron.html#sklearn.linear_model.Perceptron), [MultinomialNB](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB.html#sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB)). If you have incremental data that you want to improve your classifier over time, you may want to persist your models and then use `partial_fit` to improve them when you have new data. Works like a charm!"
