      "Pipeline is generally laid out as sequential steps and this is not a coincidence. Generally, feature extractor, feature selector and classifiers are applied in a consecutive manner for a supervised learning problem. In feature extraction, some may want to first extract bag-of-words then weight by Tf-Idf to improve the feature extractor. However, there could be also cases that some may want to __concatenate__ the features rather than applying as sequential steps. \n",
      "\n",
      "`FeatureUnion` class aims to solve this problem. You could combine different feature extractor outputs independently into a single feature matrix and then use it. This is quite useful for a number of reasons; first it works just like `pipeline`, you could give a tuple where one of the arguments is estimator name and other estimator itself. Second, the object could be used as a step in the `pipeline`, so it is very easy to use. Third, it allows you to experiment different feature extractor methods and possbily use them if you have a good feature selector method. Last but not least, it allows you to abstract the feature extraction step in a single step even if the features you aggregate could vary a lot. It does multiple feature extraction operations in parallel, so if you have multi-cores, you are in luck in terms of processing time."
